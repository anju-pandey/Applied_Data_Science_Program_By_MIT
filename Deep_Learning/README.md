# Deep Learning

In this project, we aim to apply neural network algorithms such as artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to identify the digits in the images.
This project comprises of two parts, first on ANNs and second on CNNs.

<b>Context:</b><br>
One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To build a feed-forward neural network model that can recognize the digits in the images.
- To build a CNN model that can recognize the digits in the images.
