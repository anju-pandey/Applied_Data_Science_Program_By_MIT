# Capstone Project - Facial Emotion Recognition
<b>Context:</b><br>
Deep Learning has found applications in many predictive tasks relating to more unstructured forms of data over the last few years, such as images, text, audio, and video. 

In the field of human-machine interaction, facial expression recognition is critical. From recent research, it has been found that as much as 55% of communication of sentiment takes place through facial expressions and other visual cues. Therefore, training a model to identify facial emotions accurately is an important step towards the development of emotionally intelligent behavior in machines with AI capabilities. 

<b>Objective:</b><br>
The goal of this project is to use Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to create a computer vision model that can accurately detect facial emotions. The model should be able to perform multi-class classification on images of facial expressions, to classify the expressions according to the associated emotion.
