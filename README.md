# Applied Data Science Program by MIT

I successfully completed <b>Applied Data Science Program</b> by the<b> Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professional Education</b> (November 2022 cohort) in collaboration with Great Learning, in March 2023. Many topics were covered during this program like foundation for data science, data analysis and visualization, machine learning, recommendation system, deep learning etc.

Three projects were done during this program. Details are as below:

1.	<b><a href="https://github.com/anju-pandey/Applied_Data_Science_Program_By_MIT/tree/main/Exploratory_Data_%20Analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</a></b> (aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.)

2.	<b><a href="https://github.com/anju-pandey/Applied_Data_Science_Program_By_MIT/tree/main/Deep_Learning">Deep Learning</a></b> (aim to apply neural network algorithms such as artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to identify the digits in the images.)

3.	<b><a href="https://github.com/anju-pandey/Applied_Data_Science_Program_By_MIT/tree/main/Facial_Expression_Recognition_Model">Capstone project- Facial Expression Recognition Model</a></b> (goal of this project is to use Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to create a computer vision model that can accurately detect facial emotions.)

Program was concluded with <b>live presentation</b>.

All the project files are uploaded in HTML form for viewing purpose.
